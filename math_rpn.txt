❦Math: 8/2(2+2), In RPN❦

By Felipe Lohan Pinheiro Da Silva

***

There's a viral equation that divided the internet: 8/2(2+2).

Some claims it's 01: 2+2, then *2, then you divide (÷) 8 by it.

Some claims it's 16: 8/2, then you multiply (*) it by the result of 2+2.

I decided to write both possibilities in RPN (Reverse Polish Notation).

16: 8_2_/_2_2_+_* or 2_2_+_8_2_/_*

01: 2_2_+_2_*_8_/

Note: Notice how that, in both cases, the "2_2_+" is the representation for the "(2+2)".
