Creating (Or Restoring) A Protective MBR (Master Boot Record)

By Felipe Lohan Pinheiro da Silva

***

The MBR have 512 bytes; remember that addresses start at 0h, NOT one (1).

From 000h to 1BDh (445 decimal), write whatever you want.

from 1BEh (446 decimal) to 1CDh (461) write:

00h - 00h 00h 00h - EEh - FFh FFh FFh - 01h 00h 00h 00h - FFh FFh FFh FFh

Where:

*00h to disable the classical bootable flag.

*00h 00h 00h is the starting CHS (Cylinder - Head - Sector) value.

*EEh is the signature for the GPT (GUID Partition Table).

*FFh FFh FFh is the ending CHS value.

*01h 00h 00h 00h is the first LBA (Logical Block Addressing) in the partition

*FFh FFh FFh FFh is the total number of sectors in the partition

From 1CEh (462 decimal) to 1FDh (509 decimal), write whatever you want.

Finish with 55h - AAh (the MBR signature).
