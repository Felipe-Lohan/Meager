üçåSuggestions On How To Save Bananas Through Genetic Engineeringüçå

In the Last years, people have been saying that bananas are on the verge of the extinction. The claims explains that the seeds inside the banana fruits lost their ability of reproduction, because farmers through the ages had chosen bananas w/ small seeds for convenience of their customers when eating them; so banana trees are essentially clones of one another, because this was the only viable method of reproduction; that this lack of genetic variability would be lethal to the species in case of a plague.

So, we have the following possibilities through genetic engineering:

‚Ä¢A genetic modification move the seeds into the leaves, just like what happens in fern leaves.

‚Ä¢A genetic modification move the seeds into a sack inside the black end of the banana's peel.

‚Ä¢Maybe also making a genetic modification on their flower system. Changing to a system of [hermaphrodite/bisexual] flowers, whose pollen would be easily carried by the wind.

‚Ä¢A more hardcore modification, to make genetic modification in other plants to ¬´implant¬ª banana genes on them, making them produce bananas. Good candidates are kudzu, ivy vines, ferns, etc.

Keep in mind that these solutions above aren't mutually exclusive. They could all be implemented.
