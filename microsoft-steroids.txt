Microsoft Programs On Steroids

By Felipe Lohan Pinheiro da Silva

Ok, the word “Steroid” on the title may seem too strong (due to their negative health effects in the bodybuilding industry), but you got my point anyway.

***[Notepad]***

Original Microsoft’s Notepad, despite being the standard text editor for its Windows operating system, isn’t the preferred one of many users.

Notepad needs builtin options like:

•Changing the colors of the font and the background.

•Bracket matching: when putting a cursor over a [parenthesis/brackets/quotation marks], shows its matching one.

•Auto-closing the [parenthesis/bracket/quotation mark] when one is opened.

•Autotype: when a user already have some words in his file and start to type a new word, a menu appears, letting him to choose one of the matching words, according to the first letters typed.

•Support for open source [plugin/extension]s

•[Spell/Grammar] checker (via plugins, see above).

•Syntax highlighting (via plugins, see above).

•Support for opening multiple files in new tabs.

•Line numbers.

•Menu to choose the line-ending standard (CRLF, LF, etc.), and the text encoding (UTF-8, [İSO/İEC]8859, etc.).

So you may ask, if Microsoft had the Atom text editor (via Github) (and “sunsetted” it), and now have the VS Code (and its libre incarnation, VS Codium), ¿ why to worry make these changes in the Notepad. Answer: just to improve the standard product, that comes embedded in the operating system.

***[İE (İnternet Explorer)]***

İn first place, they shouldn't even make the Edge browser. What they should to do is a continuing development in the İE itself. İt should include the support for the latest available technologies, such:

•HTML5.

•Javascript.

•[plugin/extension]s for Firefox and Chromium.

•Custom themes for web pages (background colors, fonts type, font size)

•Codecs for multimedia file formats (images, audio, and videos).

***[Wordpad]***

The middle son of the Windows family, it's neither simple like a text editor, nor feature-rich like a full-fledged word processor. İt needs at least:

•An option to export the file to the PDF (or, who knows, also to the EPUB) format.
